Engineered a robotic ping pong paddle, capable of navigating towards a moving ping pong ball. 

The robot operates by leveraging OpenCV colour detection to obtain the coordinates of the position of the ping pong ball and returns this value to the motor driver. 

By the power of Raspberry Pi, the motor driver is programmed to continuously move the DC motors towards the ping pong ball.
